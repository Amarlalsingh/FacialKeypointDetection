# FacialKeypointDetection
The objective of the project is to predict keypoint positions on human-face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1.) Tracking faces in images and video
2.) Analysing facial expressions
3.) Biometrics / face recognition
4.) Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. 
Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
